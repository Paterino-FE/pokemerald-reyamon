# pokemerald-reyamon

 Hello everyone,

 welcome to this GIT repo!
 This is the ReyaMon offical repo, a game specifically made for LongLiveReya by the community.
 
 The newest Patch can be found here: https://github.com/Paterino-FE/pokemerald-reyamon/releases
 
 We wont provide the game as a .gba file, you would need a clean Pokemon Emerald rom file to patch over it.

 Enjoy the game~
